Keylogger

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware that records every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. It's like a digital surveillance tool that captures everything typed, including:

    Passwords
    Credit card numbers
    Personal messages
    Emails
    Login credentials

Keyloggers can be:

    Software-based: Installed on the device, often maliciously by hackers
    Hardware-based: Physical device attached to the computer, like a USB drive

Keyloggers can be used for:

    Malicious purposes: Stealing sensitive information
    Monitoring: Employers/parents tracking activity
    Investigation: Law enforcement gathering evidence

To detect and prevent keyloggers:

    Use strong antivirus software
    Keep software up-to-date
    Use a firewall
    Be cautious with links and downloads
    Use virtual keyboards or one-time password generators

Remember, be mindful of your digital security and take steps to protect your personal information!
